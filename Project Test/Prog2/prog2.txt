v2.0 raw
The program starts with two variables, A and B, and does the following: 
• computes A AND B and places the result in memory location 4 
• computes A OR  B and places the result in memory location 7 
 
Initially, data memory is configured as follows: 
 
 location 0:     14 hex   (= 20 decimal) 
 location 20:   the variable A 
 location 24:   the variable B
