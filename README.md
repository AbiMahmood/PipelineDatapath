Pipeline Datapath

Summary:
•	This is a 16-bit RISC Type CPU. As an ISA designer, I have chosen 3 mixed type operands, 15 opcodes, 5 types of operations, 3 types of instruction format, and finally I have given names and values of 16 different registers.

•	This is a 16-bit CPU as a result there will be 16 registers in it. For the design, I believe simplicity favors regularity. So, I have assigned 4bits each to the opcodes, RD, RS, RT. 4 bits is fixed for the R-Type register and for the I-type, and J-Type the bits will vary in some cases because there is an immediate type. 

•	Smaller is faster. Though it is only a 16-bit CPU, it will handle very common operations. In this CPU, I tried to use as many as operations it can handle also keeping register’s values in my mind.
